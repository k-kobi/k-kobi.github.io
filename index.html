        <h1>All About Cats!</h1>
        <p><strong>There are between 40 and 70 species of cats. Breeds can have long hair, short hair or no hair. Some have giant, triangular ears, while othersâ€™ ears are rounded, floppy, or barely visible. Some have leopard-like spots, while others are vividly striped or solid white. Their likes and dislikes, temperaments and personalities can widely vary as well.
